    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 23 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-48795:\nThe SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API before 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT, Dropbear through 2022.83, Ssh before 5.1.1 in Erlang/OTP, PuTTY before 0.80, AsyncSSH before 2.14.2, golang.org/x/crypto before 0.17.0, libssh before 0.10.6, and libssh2 through 1.11.0; and there could be effects on Bitvise SSH through 9.31.\n\nCVE-2023-6004:\nUsing the ProxyCommand or the ProxyJump feature enables users to exploit unchecked hostname syntax on the client, which enables to inject malicious code into the command of the above-mentioned features through the hostname parameter. User interaction is required to exploit this issue.\n\nCVE-2023-6918:\nA flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends. The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.",
