This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS).\n\nCVE-2022-3903:\nAn incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system.\n\nCVE-2022-39188:\nAn issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs.\n\nCVE-2022-41850:\nroccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report-\u003evalue is in progress.\n\nCVE-2022-42432:\nThis vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.\n\nCVE-2022-4379:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in __nfs42_ssc_open() in fs/nfs/nfs4file.c in the Linux kernel.

The ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\nCVE-2023-0160:\nA deadlock flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s BPF subsystem.

This would allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commit 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47\n\nCVE-2023-0615:\nA memory leak flaw and potential divide by zero and Integer overflow was found in the Linux kernel V4L2 and vivid test code functionality. This issue occurs when a user triggers ioctls, such as VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS ioctl. This could allow a local user to crash the system if vivid test code enabled.\n\nCVE-2023-1078:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1206:\nA hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in the Linux kernel’s IPv6 functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.\n\nCVE-2023-1382:\nA data race flaw was found in the Linux kernel, between where con is allocated and con-\u003esock is set.

The xprt pointer may go beyond the linear part of the skb, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `rsvp_classify` function. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system and cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-4563:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the nftables sub-component due to a race problem between the set GC and transaction in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing call to `nft_set_elem_mark_busy`, causing double deactivation of the element and possibly leading to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-4623:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-4921:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue(). We recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.\n\nCVE-2023-21400:\nIn multiple functions  of io_uring.c, there is a possible kernel memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.\n\nCVE-2023-3389:\nLinux内核io_uring子系统中的释放后使用漏洞可被利用来实现本地权限提升。\n\n与链接超时竞争io_uring取消轮询请求可能会导致hrtimer中出现UAF。\n\n我们建议升级过去提交ef7dfac51d8ed961b742218f526bd589f3900a59（5.10稳定版为4716c73b188566865bdd79c3a6709696a224ac04，0e388fce7aec40992eadee654193cad345d626635.15稳定）。",
