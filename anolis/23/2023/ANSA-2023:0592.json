    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 23 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-3600:\nDuring the worker lifecycle, a use-after-free condition could have occured, which could have led to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 115.0.2, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.0.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.0.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4046:\nIn some circumstances, a stale value could have been used for a global variable in WASM JIT analysis. This resulted in incorrect compilation and a potentially exploitable crash in the content process. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4049:\nRace conditions in reference counting code were found through code inspection. These could have resulted in potentially exploitable use-after-free vulnerabilities. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4051:\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using the file open dialog. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4053:\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4054:\nWhen opening appref-ms files, Firefox did not warn the user that these files may contain malicious code. *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1, Thunderbird \u003c 102.14, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4055:\nWhen the number of cookies per domain was exceeded in `document.cookie`, the actual cookie jar sent to the host was no longer consistent with expected cookie jar state. This could have caused requests to be sent with some cookies missing. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4056:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, Firefox ESR 102.13, Thunderbird 115.0, and Thunderbird 102.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4057:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, and Thunderbird 115.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-5217:\nHeap buffer overflow in vp8 encoding in libvpx in Google Chrome prior to 117.0.5938.132 and libvpx 1.13.1 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)\n\nCVE-2023-32213:\nWhen reading a file, an uninitialized value could have been used as read limit. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.11.\n\nCVE-2023-32212:\nAn attacker could have positioned a \u003ccode\u003edatalist\u003c/code\u003e element to obscure the address bar. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.11.\n\nCVE-2023-32211:\nA type checking bug would have led to invalid code being compiled. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 113, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.11.",
