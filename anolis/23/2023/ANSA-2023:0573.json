    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 23 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-43641:\nlibcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.\n\nCVE-2023-5557:\nA flaw was found in the tracker-miners package. A weakness in the sandbox allows a maliciously-crafted file to execute code outside the sandbox if the tracker-extract process has first been compromised by a separate vulnerability.",
