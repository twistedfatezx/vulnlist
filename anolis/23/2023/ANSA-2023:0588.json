    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 23 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-29406:\nThe HTTP/1 client does not fully validate the contents of the Host header. A maliciously crafted Host header can inject additional headers or entire requests. With fix, the HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.\n\nCVE-2023-29409:\nExtremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to \u003c= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.\n\nCVE-2023-39319:\nThe html/template package does not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of \"\u003cscript\", \"\u003c!--\", and \"\u003c/script\" within JS literals in \u003cscript\u003e contexts. This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.\n\nCVE-2023-39321:\nProcessing an incomplete post-handshake message for a QUIC connection can cause a panic.\n\nCVE-2023-39322:\nQUIC connections do not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth. With fix, connections now consistently reject messages larger than 65KiB in size.\n\nCVE-2023-39323:\nLine directives (\"//line\") can be used to bypass the restrictions on \"//go:cgo_\" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when running \"go build\". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.",
