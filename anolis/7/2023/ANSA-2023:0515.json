    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 7 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-4051:\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using the file open dialog. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4053:\nA website could have obscured the full screen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4573:\nWhen receiving rendering data over IPC `mStream` could have been destroyed when initialized, which could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.15, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4574:\nWhen creating a callback over IPC for showing the Color Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.15, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4575:\nWhen creating a callback over IPC for showing the File Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.15, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4577:\nWhen `UpdateRegExpStatics` attempted to access `initialStringHeap` it could already have been garbage collected prior to entering the function, which could potentially have led to an exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4578:\nWhen calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4580:\nPush notifications stored on disk in private browsing mode were not being encrypted potentially allowing the leak of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4581:\nExcel `.xll` add-in files did not have a blocklist entry in Firefox's executable blocklist which allowed them to be downloaded without any warning of their potential harm. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.15, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4583:\nWhen checking if the Browsing Context had been discarded in `HttpBaseChannel`, if the load group was not available then it was assumed to have already been discarded which was not always the case for private channels after the private session had ended. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4584:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 102.14, Firefox ESR 115.1, Thunderbird 102.14, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.15, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.\n\nCVE-2023-4585:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 115.1, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 117, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.2, and Thunderbird \u003c 115.2.",
