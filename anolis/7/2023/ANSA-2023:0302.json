    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 7 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-34414:\nThe error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the activation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogs from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a malicious page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately before navigating to a site with a certificate error and made the renderer extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between when the error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed. With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 102.12, Firefox \u003c 114, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.12.\n\nCVE-2023-34416:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 113, Firefox ESR 102.11, and Thunderbird 102.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 102.12, Firefox \u003c 114, and Thunderbird \u003c 102.12.",
