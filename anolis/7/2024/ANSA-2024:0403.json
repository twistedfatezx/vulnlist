The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.\n\nCVE-2024-1086:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nThe nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double free vulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resembles NF_ACCEPT.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660.\n\nCVE-2024-22099:\nNULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Linux Linux kernel kernel on Linux, x86, ARM (net, bluetooth modules) allows Overflow Buffers. This vulnerability is associated with program files /net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.C.\nThis issue affects Linux kernel: v2.6.12-rc2.\n\nCVE-2024-23307:\nInteger Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in Linux Linux kernel kernel on Linux, x86, ARM (md, raid, raid5 modules) allows Forced Integer Overflow.\n\nCVE-2024-24855:\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel's scsi device driver in lpfc_unregister_fcf_rescan() function. This can result in a null pointer dereference issue, possibly leading to a kernel panic or denial of service issue.\n\nCVE-2024-26589:\nlinux内核的bpf模块中，check_flow_keys_access函数没有检查偏移是否越界，可导致越界漏洞，影响版本4.20-rc1\u003c=版本\u003c6.8-rc1包含5.10\n\nCVE-2024-26597:\nlinux内核的rmnet存在全局变量越界读，影响版本4.17-rc1\u003c=版本\u003c6.8-rc1，包含4.19和5.10",
