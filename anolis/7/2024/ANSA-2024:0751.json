    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 7 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-6816:\nA flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for each logical button currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but the X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular number of buttons, leading to a heap overflow if a bigger value was used.\n\nCVE-2024-0229:\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the X.Org server. This issue can be triggered when a device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. This issue may lead to an application crash, local privilege escalation (if the server runs with extended privileges), or remote code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments.\n\nCVE-2024-21885:\nA flaw was found in X.Org server. In the XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent function, it is possible to exceed the allocated array length when certain new device IDs are added to the xXIHierarchyInfo struct. This can trigger a heap buffer overflow condition, which may lead to an application crash or remote code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments.\n\nCVE-2024-21886:\nA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the DisableDevice function in the X.Org server. This issue may lead to an application crash or, in some circumstances, remote code execution in SSH X11 forwarding environments.",
