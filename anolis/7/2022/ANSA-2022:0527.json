    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 7 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2019-12378:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This has been disputed as not an issue.\n\nCVE-2019-12380:\n**DISPUTED** An issue was discovered in the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. phys_efi_set_virtual_address_map in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi_call_phys_prolog in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures. NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “All the code touched by the referenced commit runs only at boot, before any user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it.”.\n\nCVE-2019-12381:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: this is disputed because new_ra is never used if it is NULL.\n\nCVE-2019-12455:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “The memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.”.\n\nCVE-2019-18808:\nA memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247.\n\nCVE-2019-19046:\n** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the __ipmi_bmc_register() function in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering ida_simple_get() failure, aka CID-4aa7afb0ee20. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because an attacker cannot realistically control this failure at probe time.\n\nCVE-2019-19057:\nTwo memory leaks in the mwifiex_pcie_init_evt_ring() function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/pcie.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering mwifiex_map_pci_memory() failures, aka CID-d10dcb615c8e.\n\nCVE-2019-19067:\n** DISPUTED ** Four memory leaks in the acp_hw_init() function in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.8 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering mfd_add_hotplug_devices() or pm_genpd_add_device() failures, aka CID-57be09c6e874. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this because the attacker must already have privileges for module loading.\n\nCVE-2019-19073:\nMemory leaks in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering wait_for_completion_timeout() failures. This affects the htc_config_pipe_credits() function, the htc_setup_complete() function, and the htc_connect_service() function, aka CID-853acf7caf10.\n\nCVE-2019-19074:\nA memory leak in the ath9k_wmi_cmd() function in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/wmi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-728c1e2a05e4.\n\nCVE-2019-19077:\nA memory leak in the bnxt_re_create_srq() function in drivers/infiniband/hw/bnxt_re/ib_verbs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering copy to udata failures, aka CID-4a9d46a9fe14.\n\nCVE-2019-19241:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.4.2, the io_uring feature leads to requests that inadvertently have UID 0 and full capabilities, aka CID-181e448d8709. This is related to fs/io-wq.c, fs/io_uring.c, and net/socket.c. For example, an attacker can bypass intended restrictions on adding an IPv4 address to the loopback interface. This occurs because IORING_OP_SENDMSG operations, although requested in the context of an unprivileged user, are sometimes performed by a kernel worker thread without considering that context.\n\nCVE-2019-19462:\nrelay_open in kernel/relay.c in the Linux kernel through 5.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (such as relay blockage) by triggering a NULL alloc_percpu result.\n\nCVE-2019-19947:\nIn the Linux kernel through 5.4.6, there are information leaks of uninitialized memory to a USB device in the drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_leaf.c driver, aka CID-da2311a6385c.\n\nCVE-2019-19965:\nIn the Linux kernel through 5.4.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_discover.c because of mishandling of port disconnection during discovery, related to a PHY down race condition, aka CID-f70267f379b5.\n\nCVE-2019-20096:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.1, there is a memory leak in __feat_register_sp() in net/dccp/feat.c, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-1d3ff0950e2b.\n\nCVE-2019-20636:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.4.12, drivers/input/input.c has out-of-bounds writes via a crafted keycode table, as demonstrated by input_set_keycode, aka CID-cb222aed03d7.\n\nCVE-2020-10711:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. While processing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate that the category bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference issue while importing the same category bitmap into SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the system kernel, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2020-10732:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data.\n\nCVE-2020-10751:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernels SELinux LSM hook implementation before version 5.7, where it incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single netlink message. The hook would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted permission without further processing.\n\nCVE-2020-10766:\nA logic bug flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of SSBD. A bug in the logic handling allows an attacker with a local account to disable SSBD protection during a context switch when additional speculative execution mitigations are in place. This issue was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-10767:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of the Enhanced IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier). The IBPB mitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when the Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a Spectre V2 style attack when this configuration is active. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-10768:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the prctl() function, where it can be used to enable indirect branch speculation after it has been disabled. This call incorrectly reports it as being 'force disabled' when it is not and opens the system to Spectre v2 attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-10781:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable.\n\nCVE-2020-10942:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.5.8, get_raw_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacks validation of an sk_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls.\n\nCVE-2020-11565:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.”.\n\nCVE-2020-11608:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/ov519.c allows NULL pointer dereferences in ov511_mode_init_regs and ov518_mode_init_regs when there are zero endpoints, aka CID-998912346c0d.\n\nCVE-2020-11609:\nAn issue was discovered in the stv06xx subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx.c and drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx_pb0100.c mishandle invalid descriptors, as demonstrated by a NULL pointer dereference, aka CID-485b06aadb93.\n\nCVE-2020-11668:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.6.1, drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB driver) mishandles invalid descriptors, aka CID-a246b4d54770.\n\nCVE-2020-12465:\nAn array overflow was discovered in mt76_add_fragment in drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/dma.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5.10, aka CID-b102f0c522cf. An oversized packet with too many rx fragments can corrupt memory of adjacent pages.\n\nCVE-2020-12655:\nAn issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\nCVE-2020-12657:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6.5. There is a use-after-free in block/bfq-iosched.c related to bfq_idle_slice_timer_body.\n\nCVE-2020-12768:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.6. svm_cpu_uninit in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c has a memory leak, aka CID-d80b64ff297e. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it's a one-time leak at the boot, the size is negligible, and it can't be triggered at will.\n\nCVE-2020-12769:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.17. drivers/spi/spi-dw.c allows attackers to cause a panic via concurrent calls to dw_spi_irq and dw_spi_transfer_one, aka CID-19b61392c5a8.\n\nCVE-2020-12888:\nThe VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandles attempts to access disabled memory space.\n\nCVE-2020-13974:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case.\n\nCVE-2020-14314:\nA memory out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc2 with the ext3/ext4 file system, in the way it accesses a directory with broken indexing. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system if the directory exists. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-14351:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free memory flaw was found in the perf subsystem allowing a local attacker with permission to monitor perf events to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-14385:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-14386:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. Memory corruption can be exploited to gain root privileges from unprivileged processes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-14416:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.4.16, a race condition in tty-\u003edisc_data handling in the slip and slcan line discipline could lead to a use-after-free, aka CID-0ace17d56824. This affects drivers/net/slip/slip.c and drivers/net/can/slcan.c.\n\nCVE-2020-15436:\nUse-after-free vulnerability in fs/block_dev.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service by leveraging improper access to a certain error field.\n\nCVE-2020-16119:\nUse-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being released. Fixed in Ubuntu Linux kernel 5.4.0-51.56, 5.3.0-68.63, 4.15.0-121.123, 4.4.0-193.224, 3.13.0.182.191 and 3.2.0-149.196.\n\nCVE-2020-16166:\nThe Linux kernel through 5.7.11 allows remote attackers to make observations that help to obtain sensitive information about the internal state of the network RNG, aka CID-f227e3ec3b5c. This is related to drivers/char/random.c and kernel/time/timer.c.\n\nCVE-2020-1749:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networking protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When an encrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctly routing tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the data unencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-25211:\nIn the Linux kernel through 5.8.7, local attackers able to inject conntrack netlink configuration could overflow a local buffer, causing crashes or triggering use of incorrect protocol numbers in ctnetlink_parse_tuple_filter in net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_netlink.c, aka CID-1cc5ef91d2ff.\n\nCVE-2020-25212:\nA TOCTOU mismatch in the NFS client code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.3 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory or possibly have unspecified other impact because a size check is in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c instead of fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c, aka CID-b4487b935452.\n\nCVE-2020-25284:\nThe rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe.\n\nCVE-2020-25285:\nA race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified other impact, aka CID-17743798d812.\n\nCVE-2020-25645:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9-rc7. Traffic between two Geneve endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel allowing anyone between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-25656:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free was found in the way the console subsystem was using ioctls KDGKBSENT and KDSKBSENT. A local user could use this flaw to get read memory access out of bounds. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nCVE-2020-25668:\nA flaw was found in Linux Kernel because access to the global variable fg_console is not properly synchronized leading to a use after free in con_font_op.\n\nCVE-2020-25704:\nA flaw memory leak in the Linux kernel performance monitoring subsystem was found in the way if using PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\nCVE-2020-25705:\nA flaw in ICMP packets in the Linux kernel may allow an attacker to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote attacker to effectively bypass source port UDP randomization. Software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well on the Linux Based Products (RUGGEDCOM RM1224: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE M-800: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE S615: All versions between v5.0 and v6.4, SCALANCE SC-600: All versions prior to v2.1.3, SCALANCE W1750D: v8.3.0.1, v8.6.0, and v8.7.0, SIMATIC Cloud Connect 7: All versions, SIMATIC MV500 Family: All versions, SIMATIC NET CP 1243-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants): Versions 3.1.39 and later, SIMATIC NET CP 1243-7 LTE EU: Version\n\nCVE-2020-27825:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c in Linux kernel (before 5.10-rc1). There was a race problem in trace_open and resize of cpu buffer running parallely on different cpus, may cause a denial of service problem (DOS). This flaw could even allow a local attacker with special user privilege to a kernel information leak threat.\n\nCVE-2020-28374:\nIn drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.\n\nCVE-2020-28974:\nA slab-out-of-bounds read in fbcon in the Linux kernel before 5.9.7 could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or potentially crash the kernel, aka CID-3c4e0dff2095. This occurs because KD_FONT_OP_COPY in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c can be used for manipulations such as font height.\n\nCVE-2020-29369:\nAn issue was discovered in mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.11.

The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.\n\nCVE-2020-29660:\nA locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID, aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.\n\nCVE-2020-29661:\nA locking issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP, aka CID-54ffccbf053b.\n\nCVE-2020-36516:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16.11. The mixed IPID assignment method with the hash-based IPID assignment policy allows an off-path attacker to inject data into a victim's TCP session or terminate that session.\n\nCVE-2020-8428:\nfs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed.\n\nCVE-2020-8647:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vc_do_resize function in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c.\n\nCVE-2020-8648:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the n_tty_receive_buf_common function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c.\n\nCVE-2020-8649:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vgacon_invert_region function in drivers/video/console/vgacon.c.\n\nCVE-2021-20200:\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.\n\nCVE-2021-20317:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.\n\nCVE-2021-20321:\nA race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2021-20322:\nA flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.\n\nCVE-2021-22555:\nA heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space\n\nCVE-2021-27363:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernel pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with the iSCSI subsystem, the transport's handle is available to unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at /sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the show_transport_handle function (in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport struct in the kernel module's global variables.\n\nCVE-2021-27364:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c is adversely affected by the ability of an unprivileged user to craft Netlink messages.\n\nCVE-2021-27365:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message.\n\nCVE-2021-28964:\nA race condition was discovered in get_old_root in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG) because of a lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation, aka CID-dbcc7d57bffc.\n\nCVE-2021-28971:\nIn intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8 on some Haswell CPUs, userspace applications (such as perf-fuzzer) can cause a system crash because the PEBS status in a PEBS record is mishandled, aka CID-d88d05a9e0b6.\n\nCVE-2021-28972:\nIn drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8, the RPA PCI Hotplug driver has a user-tolerable buffer overflow when writing a new device name to the driver from userspace, allowing userspace to write data to the kernel stack frame directly. This occurs because add_slot_store and remove_slot_store mishandle drc_name '\\0' termination, aka CID-cc7a0bb058b8.\n\nCVE-2021-29154:\nBPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context.
