    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 7 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2018-5740:\n\"deny-answer-aliases\" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0-\u003e9.8.8, 9.9.0-\u003e9.9.13, 9.10.0-\u003e9.10.8, 9.11.0-\u003e9.11.4, 9.12.0-\u003e9.12.2, 9.13.0-\u003e9.13.2.\n\nCVE-2018-5743:\nBy design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -\u003e 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -\u003e 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5743.\n\nCVE-2019-6465:\nControls for zone transfers may not be properly applied to Dynamically Loadable Zones (DLZs) if the zones are writable Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -\u003e 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.5-P2, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.3-P2, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -\u003e 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2019-6465.\n\nCVE-2020-8616:\nA malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.\n\nCVE-2020-8617:\nUsing a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.",
