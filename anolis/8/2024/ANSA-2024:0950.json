    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-9392:\nA compromised content process could have allowed for the arbitrary loading of cross-origin pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9393:\nAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to \"same site\" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9394:\nAn attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://devtools` origin.  This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON content. This access is limited to \"same site\" documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9396:\nIt is currently unknown if this issue is exploitable but a condition may arise where the structured clone of certain objects could lead to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9397:\nA missing delay in directory upload UI could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permission via clickjacking. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9398:\nBy checking the result of calls to `window.open` with specifically set protocol handlers, an attacker could determine if the application which implements that protocol handler is installed. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9399:\nA website configured to initiate a specially crafted WebTransport session could crash the Firefox process leading to a denial of service condition. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9400:\nA potential memory corruption vulnerability could be triggered if an attacker had the ability to trigger an OOM at a specific moment during JIT compilation. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9401:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 115.15, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Firefox ESR \u003c 115.16, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9402:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.3, Thunderbird \u003c 128.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 131.\n\nCVE-2024-9403:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 130. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 131 and Thunderbird \u003c 131.",
