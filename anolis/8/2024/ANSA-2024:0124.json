    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-3961:\nA path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.\n\nCVE-2023-4091:\nA vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module \"acl_xattr\" is configured with \"acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes\". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's permissions.\n\nCVE-2023-42669:\nA vulnerability was found in Samba's \"rpcecho\" development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the \"rpcecho\" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the \"rpcecho\" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a \"sleep()\" call in the \"dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()\" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the \"rpcecho\" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as \"rpcecho\" runs in the main RPC task.",
