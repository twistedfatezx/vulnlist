This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-1989:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btsdio_remove in drivers\\bluetooth\\btsdio.c in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to btsdio_remove with an unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading to a UAF on hdev devices.\n\nCVE-2023-1998:\nThe Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by calling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.\n\nCVE-2023-20569:\nA side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-2162:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create in drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c in SCSI sub-component in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw an attacker could leak kernel internal information.\n\nCVE-2023-2163:\nIncorrect verifier pruning in BPF in Linux Kernel \u003e=5.4 leads to unsafe\ncode paths being incorrectly marked as safe, resulting in arbitrary read/write in\nkernel memory, lateral privilege escalation, and container escape.\n\nCVE-2023-2166:\nA null pointer dereference issue was found in can protocol in net/can/af_can.c in the Linux before Linux. ml_priv may not be initialized in the receive path of CAN frames. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-2176:\nA vulnerability was found in compare_netdev_and_ip in drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c in RDMA in the Linux Kernel. The improper cleanup results in out-of-boundary read, where a local user can utilize this problem to crash the system or escalation of privilege.\n\nCVE-2023-2269:\nA denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.\n\nCVE-2023-23455:\natm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).\n\nCVE-2023-2513:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem in the way it handled the extra inode size for extended attributes. This flaw could allow a privileged local user to cause a system crash or other undefined behaviors.\n\nCVE-2023-26545:\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.13, there is a double free in net/mpls/af_mpls.c upon an allocation failure (for registering the sysctl table under a new location) during the renaming of a device.\n\nCVE-2023-28328:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in the Linux Kernel.

There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(\u0026fepriv-\u003esem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(\u0026fepriv-\u003esem) may block the process.\n\nCVE-2023-3141:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in r592_remove in drivers/memstick/host/r592.c in media access in the Linux Kernel.

A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).\n\nCVE-2023-4206:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nWhen route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.\n\nCVE-2023-4207:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nWhen fw_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter.

This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-45871:\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.\n\nCVE-2023-4622:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nThe unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.\n\nCVE-2023-4623:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nIf a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-46813:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable by local users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the SEV-ES emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access to kernel memory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction before the #VC handler reads it.\n\nCVE-2023-4732:\nA flaw was found in pfn_swap_entry_to_page in memory management subsystem in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a local user privilege may cause a denial of service problem due to a BUG statement referencing pmd_t x.\n\nCVE-2023-4921:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nWhen the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue().\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.\n\nCVE-2023-51043:\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.4.5, drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic.c has a use-after-free during a race condition between a nonblocking atomic commit and a driver unload.\n\nCVE-2023-5178:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in drivers/nvme/target/tcp.c` in `nvmet_tcp_free_crypto` due to a logical bug in the NVMe/TCP subsystem in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a malicious user to cause a use-after-free and double-free problem, which may permit remote code execution or lead to local privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-5633:\nThe reference count changes made as part of the CVE-2023-33951 and CVE-2023-33952 fixes exposed a use-after-free flaw in the way memory objects were handled when they were being used to store a surface.

This issue may allow an unauthenticated malicious actor to send a set of crafted TCP packages when using NVMe over TCP, leading the NVMe driver to a NULL pointer dereference in the NVMe driver, causing kernel panic and a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-6606:\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smbCalcSize in fs/smb/client/netmisc.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2023-6610:\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in smb2_dump_detail in fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2023-6817:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\nThe function nft_pipapo_walk did not skip inactive elements during set walk which could lead double deactivations of PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-after-free.\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a.\n\nCVE-2024-0443:\nA flaw was found in the blkgs destruction path in block/blk-cgroup.c in the Linux kernel, leading to a cgroup blkio memory leakage problem. When a cgroup is being destroyed, cgroup_rstat_flush() is only called at css_release_work_fn(), which is called when the blkcg reference count reaches 0. This circular dependency will prevent blkcg and some blkgs from being freed after they are made offline. This issue may allow an attacker with a local access to cause system instability, such as an out of memory error.\n\nCVE-2024-0646:\nAn out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Transport Layer Security functionality in how a user calls a function splice with a ktls socket as the destination. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.",
