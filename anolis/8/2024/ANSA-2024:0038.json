    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-0056:\nA vulnerability was found in the .NET Framework. This vulnerability exists in the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider where an attackercan perform an AiTM (adversary-in-the-middle) attack between the SQL client and the SQL server. This may allow the attacker to steal authentication credentials intended for the database server, even if the connection is established over an encrypted channel like TLS.\n\nCVE-2024-0057:\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\n\nCVE-2024-21319:\nA Denial of Service vulnerability was found in .NET Core project templates that utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This issue may allow an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests.\n\nCVE-2023-46233:\nA vulnerability was found in crypto-js in how PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993 and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than the current industry standard. This issue is because both default to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and default to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on the iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks.",
