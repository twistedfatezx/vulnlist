    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-3424:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s SGI GRU driver in the way the first gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-3643:\nGuests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.\n\nCVE-2022-3903:\nAn incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system.\n\nCVE-2022-41849:\ndrivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-45887:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/usb/ttusb-dec/ttusb_dec.c has a memory leak because of the lack of a dvb_frontend_detach call.\n\nCVE-2023-0615:\nA memory leak flaw and potential divide by zero and Integer overflow was found in the Linux kernel V4L2 and vivid test code functionality. This issue occurs when a user triggers ioctls, such as VIDIOC_S_DV_TIMINGS ioctl. This could allow a local user to crash the system if vivid test code enabled.\n\nCVE-2023-1079:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data.\n\nCVE-2023-1206:\nA hash collision flaw was found in the IPv6 connection lookup table in the Linux kernel’s IPv6 functionality when a user makes a new kind of SYN flood attack. A user located in the local network or with a high bandwidth connection can increase the CPU usage of the server that accepts IPV6 connections up to 95%.\n\nCVE-2023-1390:\nA remote denial of service vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel’s TIPC kernel module. The while loop in tipc_link_xmit() hits an unknown state while attempting to parse SKBs, which are not in the queue. Sending two small UDP packets to a system with a UDP bearer results in the CPU utilization for the system to instantly spike to 100%, causing a denial of service condition.\n\nCVE-2023-1513:\nA flaw was found in KVM. When calling the KVM_GET_DEBUGREGS ioctl, on 32-bit systems, there might be some uninitialized portions of the kvm_debugregs structure that could be copied to userspace, causing an information leak.\n\nCVE-2023-2002:\nA vulnerability was found in the HCI sockets implementation due to a missing capability check in net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to unauthorized execution of management commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communication.\n\nCVE-2023-20569:\nA side channel vulnerability on some of the AMD CPUs may allow an attacker to influence the return address prediction. This may result in speculative execution at an attacker-controlled address, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-20593:\nAn issue in “Zen 2” CPUs, under specific microarchitectural circumstances, may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2023-2860:\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the SR-IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. The flaw exists within the processing of seg6 attributes. The issue results from the improper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a privileged local user to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux kernel.\n\nCVE-2023-3006:\nA known cache speculation vulnerability, known as Branch History Injection (BHI) or Spectre-BHB, becomes actual again for the new hw AmpereOne. Spectre-BHB is similar to Spectre v2, except that malicious code uses the shared branch history (stored in the CPU Branch History Buffer, or BHB) to influence mispredicted branches within the victim's hardware context. Once that occurs, speculation caused by the mispredicted branches can cause cache allocation. This issue leads to obtaining information that should not be accessible.\n\nCVE-2023-31083:\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. In hci_uart_tty_ioctl, there is a race condition between HCIUARTSETPROTO and HCIUARTGETPROTO. HCI_UART_PROTO_SET is set before hu-\u003eproto is set. A NULL pointer dereference may occur.\n\nCVE-2023-31085:\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/mtd/ubi/cdev.c in the Linux kernel 6.2. There is a divide-by-zero error in do_div(sz,mtd-\u003eerasesize), used indirectly by ctrl_cdev_ioctl, when mtd-\u003eerasesize is 0.\n\nCVE-2023-3159:\nA use after free issue was discovered in driver/firewire in outbound_phy_packet_callback in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with special privilege may cause a use after free problem when queue_event() fails.\n\nCVE-2023-3161:\nA flaw was found in the Framebuffer Console (fbcon) in the Linux Kernel. When providing font-\u003ewidth and font-\u003eheight greater than 32 to fbcon_set_font, since there are no checks in place, a shift-out-of-bounds occurs leading to undefined behavior and possible denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-3358:\nA null pointer dereference was found in the Linux kernel's Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) driver. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2023-3567:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in vcs_read in drivers/tty/vt/vc_screen.c in vc_screen in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow an attacker with local user access to cause a system crash or leak internal kernel information.\n\nCVE-2023-35823:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in saa7134_finidev in drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-core.c.\n\nCVE-2023-35824:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in dm1105_remove in drivers/media/pci/dm1105/dm1105.c.\n\nCVE-2023-35828:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.2. A use-after-free was found in renesas_usb3_remove in drivers/usb/gadget/udc/renesas_usb3.c.\n\nCVE-2023-39192:\nA flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The xt_u32 module did not validate the fields in the xt_u32 structure. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read by setting the size fields with a value beyond the array boundaries, leading to a crash or information disclosure.\n\nCVE-2023-4128:\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CVE RECORD. ConsultIDs: CVE-2023-4206, CVE-2023-4207, CVE-2023-4208. Reason: This record is a duplicate of CVE-2023-4206, CVE-2023-4207, CVE-2023-4208. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2023-4206, CVE-2023-4207, CVE-2023-4208 instead of this record. All references and descriptions in this record have been removed to prevent accidental usage.\n\nCVE-2023-4132:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the siano smsusb module in the Linux kernel. The bug occurs during device initialization when the siano device is plugged in. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system, causing a denial of service condition.\n\nCVE-2023-42755:\nA flaw was found in the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) classifier in the Linux kernel. The xprt pointer may go beyond the linear part of the skb, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `rsvp_classify` function. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system and cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-4385:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in dbFree in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in the journaling file system (JFS) in the Linux Kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a missing sanity check.\n\nCVE-2023-4387:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf in drivers/net/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c in VMware's vmxnet3 ethernet NIC driver in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a double-free while cleaning up vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all, which could also lead to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-45863:\nAn issue was discovered in lib/kobject.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.3. With root access, an attacker can trigger a race condition that results in a fill_kobj_path out-of-bounds write.\n\nCVE-2023-45871:\nAn issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.\n\nCVE-2023-4623:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent, but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free. We recommend upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.\n\nCVE-2023-4921:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc, sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking in agg_dequeue(). We recommend upgrading past commit 8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.\n\nCVE-2023-5717:\nA heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. We recommend upgrading past commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.\n\nCVE-2023-6931:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Performance Events system component. A condition can be triggered that allows data to be written past the end or before the beginning of the intended memory buffer. This may lead to a system crash, code execution, or local privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-6932:\nA race condition has been discovered in the Linux kernel's Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) implementation. This vulnerability may enable an attacker to provoke an application crash or potentially escalate privileges locally. By exploiting the race condition, an adversary could disrupt the normal operation of affected systems, leading to service disruption or, in the worst case, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.",
