    "Description": "The Linux kernel, based on version 5.10.134, heavily modified with backports\n\nCVE-2021-33061:\nInsufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\nCVE-2021-3759:\nA memory overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel’s ipc functionality of the memcg subsystem, in the way a user calls the semget function multiple times, creating semaphores. This flaw allows a local user to starve the resources, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2022-3606:\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function find_prog_by_sec_insn of the file tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211749 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-36280:\nAn out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128 (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS).\n\nCVE-2022-3707:\nA double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-39188:\nAn issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs.\n\nCVE-2022-4095:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.19.2. This issue occurs in cmd_hdl_filter in drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl8712_cmd.c, allowing an attacker to launch a local denial of service attack and gain escalation of privileges.\n\nCVE-2022-41849:\ndrivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-42432:\nThis vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux Kernel 6.0-rc2. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the nft_osf_eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-18540.\n\nCVE-2022-4379:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in __nfs42_ssc_open() in fs/nfs/nfs4file.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a remote denial\n\nCVE-2022-4382:\nA use-after-free flaw caused by a race among the superblock operations in the gadgetfs Linux driver was found. It could be triggered by yanking out a device that is running the gadgetfs side.\n\nCVE-2022-4662:\nA flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-4744:\nA double-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user registers the device when the register_netdevice function fails (NETDEV_REGISTER notifier). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-47521:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_CHANNEL_LIST in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the operating channel attribute from Wi-Fi management frames.\n\nCVE-2022-47929:\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.\n\nCVE-2023-0045:\nThe current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\nCVE-2023-0386:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernel’s OverlayFS subsystem in how a user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-0458:\nA speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit 739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11\n\nCVE-2023-0459:\nCopy_from_user on 64-bit versions of the Linux kernel does not implement the __uaccess_begin_nospec allowing a user to bypass the \"access_ok\" check and pass a kernel pointer to copy_from_user(). This would allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commit 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47\n\nCVE-2023-0461:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c\n\nCVE-2023-0590:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem. This flaw leads to a denial of service issue. If patch ebda44da44f6 (\"net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()\") not applied yet, then kernel could be affected.\n\nCVE-2023-0597:\nA flaw possibility of memory leak in the Linux kernel cpu_entry_area mapping of X86 CPU data to memory was found in the way user can guess location of exception stack(s) or other important data. A local user could use this flaw to get access to some important data with expected location in memory.\n\nCVE-2023-1073:\nA memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1074:\nA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-1075:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tls_is_tx_ready() incorrectly checks for list emptiness, potentially accessing a type confused entry to the list_head, leaking the last byte of the confused field that overlaps with rec-\u003etx_ready.\n\nCVE-2023-1076:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\nCVE-2023-1077:\nIn the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1078:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1095:\nIn nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nCVE-2023-1118:\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1281:\nUse After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.\n\nCVE-2023-1380:\nA slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur when assoc_info-\u003ereq_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading to a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-1382:\nA data race flaw was found in the Linux kernel, between where con is allocated and con-\u003esock is set. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing con-\u003esock-\u003esk in net/tipc/topsrv.c in the tipc protocol in the Linux kernel.\n\nCVE-2023-1611:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btrfs_search_slot in fs/btrfs/ctree.c in btrfs in the Linux Kernel.This flaw allows an attacker to crash the system and possibly cause a kernel information lea\n\nCVE-2023-1670:\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1829:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.\n\nCVE-2023-1855:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xgene_hwmon_remove in drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c in the Hardware Monitoring Linux Kernel Driver (xgene-hwmon). This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem. This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-1859:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xen_9pfs_front_removet in net/9p/trans_xen.c in Xen transport for 9pfs in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem, possibly leading to a kernel information leak.\n\nCVE-2023-1989:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btsdio_remove in drivers\\bluetooth\\btsdio.c in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to btsdio_remove with an unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading to a UAF on hdev devices.\n\nCVE-2023-1990:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in ndlc_remove in drivers/nfc/st-nci/ndlc.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system due to a race problem.\n\nCVE-2023-2002:\nA vulnerability was found in the HCI sockets implementation due to a missing capability check in net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to unauthorized execution of management commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communication.\n\nCVE-2023-20928:\nIn binder_vma_close of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-254837884References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2023-20938:\nIn binder_transaction_buffer_release of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-257685302References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2023-2124:\nAn out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s XFS file system in how a user restores an XFS image after failure (with a dirty log journal).
