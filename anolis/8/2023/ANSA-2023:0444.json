    "Description": "The Linux kernel, based on version 4.19.91, heavily modified with backports\n\nCVE-2020-0404:\nIn uvc_scan_chain_forward of uvc_driver.c, there is a possible linked list corruption due to an unusual root cause. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-111893654References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-1184:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel’s filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-20423:\nIn rndis_set_response of rndis.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege if a malicious USB device is attached with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-239842288References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-33742:\nLinux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\nCVE-2022-36280:\nAn out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file '/dev/dri/renderD128 (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on the system to gain privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS).\n\nCVE-2022-3707:\nA double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-4095:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.19.2. This issue occurs in cmd_hdl_filter in drivers/staging/rtl8712/rtl8712_cmd.c, allowing an attacker to launch a local denial of service attack and gain escalation of privileges.\n\nCVE-2022-41850:\nroccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a report-\u003evalue is in progress.\n\nCVE-2023-0045:\nThe current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB immediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates the Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB, prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96\n\nCVE-2023-0458:\nA speculative pointer dereference problem exists in the Linux Kernel on the do_prlimit() function. The resource argument value is controlled and is used in pointer arithmetic for the 'rlim' variable and can be used to leak the contents. We recommend upgrading past version 6.1.8 or commit 739790605705ddcf18f21782b9c99ad7d53a8c11\n\nCVE-2023-1073:\nA memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1076:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\nCVE-2023-1077:\nIn the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1078:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1670:\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel Xircom 16-bit PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet driver was found.A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1829:\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.\n\nCVE-2023-1855:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in xgene_hwmon_remove in drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c in the Hardware Monitoring Linux Kernel Driver (xgene-hwmon). This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system due to a race problem. This vulnerability could even lead to a kernel information leak problem.\n\nCVE-2023-1989:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in btsdio_remove in drivers\\bluetooth\\btsdio.c in the Linux Kernel. In this flaw, a call to btsdio_remove with an unfinished job, may cause a race problem leading to a UAF on hdev devices.\n\nCVE-2023-1990:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in ndlc_remove in drivers/nfc/st-nci/ndlc.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow an attacker to crash the system due to a race problem.\n\nCVE-2023-2194:\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's SLIMpro I2C device driver. The userspace \"data-\u003eblock[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution.\n\nCVE-2023-2269:\nA denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.\n\nCVE-2023-23000:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.17, drivers/phy/tegra/xusb.c mishandles the tegra_xusb_find_port_node return value. Callers expect NULL in the error case, but an error pointer is used.\n\nCVE-2023-2513:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem in the way it handled the extra inode size for extended attributes. This flaw could allow a privileged local user to cause a system crash or other undefined behaviors.\n\nCVE-2023-26607:\nIn the Linux kernel 6.0.8, there is an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_attr_find in fs/ntfs/attrib.c.\n\nCVE-2023-28328:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-2985:\nA use after free flaw was found in hfsplus_put_super in fs/hfsplus/super.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw could allow a local user to cause a denial of service problem.\n\nCVE-2023-30772:\nThe Linux kernel before 6.2.9 has a race condition and resultant use-after-free in drivers/power/supply/da9150-charger.c if a physically proximate attacker unplugs a device.\n\nCVE-2023-3117:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel when processing named and anonymous sets in batch requests, which can lead to performing arbitrary reads and writes in kernel memory. This flaw allows a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-3220:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.1-rc8. dpu_crtc_atomic_check in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_crtc.c lacks check of the return value of kzalloc() and will cause the NULL Pointer Dereference.\n\nCVE-2023-3268:\nAn out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel in relay_file_read_start_pos in kernel/relay.c in the relayfs. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.\n\nCVE-2023-35001:\nLinux Kernel nftables Out-Of-Bounds Read/Write Vulnerability; nft_byteorder poorly handled vm register contents when CAP_NET_ADMIN is in any user or network namespace\n\nCVE-2023-35788:\nAn issue was discovered in fl_set_geneve_opt in net/sched/cls_flower.c in the Linux kernel before 6.3.7. It allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier code via TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE packets. This may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.\n\nCVE-2023-35825:\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2023-3141.
