    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-27664:\nIn net/http in Go before 1.18.6 and 1.19.x before 1.19.1, attackers can cause a denial of service because an HTTP/2 connection can hang during closing if shutdown were preempted by a fatal error.\n\nCVE-2022-2880:\nRequests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http. This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a parameter with an unparsable value. After fix, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward the original query parameters unchanged.\n\nCVE-2022-39229:\nGrafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email address as a username. A Grafana user’s username and email address are unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can register their username as `user_1`’s email address. This prevents `user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won’t match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\nCVE-2022-41715:\nPrograms which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.",
