    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-25751:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of invalidating JIT code while following an iterator. The newly generated code could be overwritten incorrectly, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-25752:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that when accessing throttled streams, the count of available bytes needs to be checked in the calling function to be within bounds. This may have led future code to be incorrect and vulnerable.\n\nCVE-2023-28162:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that while implementing AudioWorklets, some code may have cast one type to another, invalid, dynamic type. This could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2023-28164:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory described the issue of dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe that was removed during the drag could have led to user confusion and website spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2023-28176:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory described the issue in which Mozilla developers Timothy Nikkel, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 110 and ESR 102.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, and we presume that with enough effort, some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
