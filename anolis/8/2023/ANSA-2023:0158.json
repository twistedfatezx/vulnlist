    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-26341:\nSome AMD CPUs may transiently execute beyond unconditional direct branches, which may potentially result in data leakage.\n\nCVE-2021-33655:\nWhen sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write memory out of bounds.\n\nCVE-2021-33656:\nWhen setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds.\n\nCVE-2022-1462:\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in how a user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage of memory in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or read unauthorized random data from memory.\n\nCVE-2022-1679:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Atheros wireless adapter driver in the way a user forces the ath9k_htc_wait_for_target function to fail with some input messages. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-1789:\nWith shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nCVE-2022-20141:\nIn ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-112551163References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-2196:\nA regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed for speculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at L2 with code execution can execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine. We recommend upgrading to Kernel 6.2 or past commit 2e7eab81425a\n\nCVE-2022-25265:\nIn the Linux kernel through 5.16.10, certain binary files may have the exec-all attribute if they were built in approximately 2003 (e.g., with GCC 3.2.2 and Linux kernel 2.4.20). This can cause execution of bytes located in supposedly non-executable regions of a file.\n\nCVE-2022-2663:\nAn issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured.\n\nCVE-2022-3028:\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.\n\nCVE-2022-30594:\nThe Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.\n\nCVE-2022-3239:\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel video4linux driver was found in the way user triggers em28xx_usb_probe() for the Empia 28xx based TV cards. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-3522:\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.\n\nCVE-2022-3524:\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel.

The identifier VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3628:\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges.\n\nCVE-2022-3707:\nA double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-39188:\nAn issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs.\n\nCVE-2022-39189:\nAn issue was discovered the x86 KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.18.17. Unprivileged guest users can compromise the guest kernel because TLB flush operations are mishandled in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations.\n\nCVE-2022-41218:\nIn drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release.\n\nCVE-2022-4129:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-41674:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c.\n\nCVE-2022-42703:\nmm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse.\n\nCVE-2022-42720:\nVarious refcounting bugs in the multi-BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to trigger use-after-free conditions to potentially execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-42721:\nA list management bug in BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to corrupt a linked list and, in turn, potentially execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-42722:\nIn the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers able to inject WLAN frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL pointer dereference denial-of-service attack against the beacon protection of P2P devices.\n\nCVE-2022-43750:\ndrivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory.\n\nCVE-2022-47929:\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with \"tc qdisc\" and \"tc class\" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.\n\nCVE-2023-0394:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-0461:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c\n\nCVE-2023-1195:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in reconn_set_ipaddr_from_hostname in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs when it forgets to set the free pointer server-\u003ehostname to NULL, leading to an invalid pointer request.\n\nCVE-2023-1582:\nA race problem was found in fs/proc/task_mmu.c in the memory management sub-component in the Linux kernel. This issue may allow a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-23454:\ncbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).",
