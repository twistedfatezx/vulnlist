It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.\n\nCVE-2022-3707:\nA double-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The Intel GVT-g graphics driver triggers VGA card system resource overload, causing a fail in the intel_gvt_dma_map_guest_page function.

Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).\n\nCVE-2022-42703:\nmm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse.\n\nCVE-2022-42719:\nA use-after-free in the mac80211 stack when parsing a multi-BSSID element in the Linux kernel 5.2 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to crash the kernel and potentially execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-42720:\nVarious refcounting bugs in the multi-BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to trigger use-after-free conditions to potentially execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-42721:\nA list management bug in BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to corrupt a linked list and, in turn, potentially execute code.\n\nCVE-2022-42722:\nIn the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers able to inject WLAN frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL pointer dereference denial-of-service attack against the beacon protection of P2P devices.\n\nCVE-2022-42895:\nThere is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1a2cd50c0357f243b7435a732b4e62ba3157a2e https://www.google.com/url\n\nCVE-2022-42896:\nThere are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively) remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within proximity of the victim. We recommend upgrading past commit https://www.google.com/url https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/711f8c3fb3db61897080468586b970c87c61d9e4 https://www.google.com/url\n\nCVE-2022-4378:\nA stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL subsystem in how a user changes certain kernel parameters and variables. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-45934:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets.\n\nCVE-2022-4662:\nA flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-4696:\nThere exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current-\u003ensproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current-\u003ensproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above\n\nCVE-2022-4744:\nA double-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TUN/TAP device driver functionality in how a user registers the device when the register_netdevice function fails (NETDEV_REGISTER notifier). This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2022-47518:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of the number of channels in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow when copying the list of operating channels from Wi-Fi management frames.\n\nCVE-2022-47519:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_OPER_CHANNEL in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds write when parsing the channel list attribute from Wi-Fi management frames.\n\nCVE-2022-47520:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing offset validation in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds read when parsing a Robust Security Network (RSN) information element from a Netlink packet.\n\nCVE-2022-47521:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11.

A use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15 longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of io_sqpoll_wait_sq.\n\nCVE-2023-0179:\nA buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux Kernel. This issue could allow the leakage of both stack and heap addresses, and potentially allow Local Privilege Escalation to the root user via arbitrary code execution.\n\nCVE-2023-0266:\nA use after free vulnerability exists in the ALSA PCM package in the Linux Kernel. SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 is missing locks that can be used in a use-after-free that can result in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user. We recommend upgrading past commit 56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e\n\nCVE-2023-0394:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-0461:\nThere is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c\n\nCVE-2023-0590:\nA use-after-free flaw was found in qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c in the Linux Kernel due to a race problem.

A local user could use this flaw to get access to some important data with expected location in memory.\n\nCVE-2023-1073:\nA memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1074:\nA memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2023-1076:\nA flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.\n\nCVE-2023-1077:\nIn the Linux kernel, pick_next_rt_entity() may return a type confused entry, not detected by the BUG_ON condition, as the confused entry will not be NULL, but list_head.The buggy error condition would lead to a type confused entry with the list head,which would then be used as a type confused sched_rt_entity,causing memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2023-1095:\nIn nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nCVE-2023-1118:\nA flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-1281:\nUse After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2.\n\nCVE-2023-23000:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.17, drivers/phy/tegra/xusb.c mishandles the tegra_xusb_find_port_node return value. Callers expect NULL in the error case, but an error pointer is used.\n\nCVE-2023-23004:\nIn the Linux kernel before 5.19, drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_planes.c misinterprets the get_sg_table return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer).\n\nCVE-2023-23454:\ncbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).\n\nCVE-2023-23455:\natm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).\n\nCVE-2023-23559:\nIn rndis_query_oid in drivers/net/wireless/rndis_wlan.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.5, there is an integer overflow in an addition.\n\nCVE-2023-22998:\nIn the Linux kernel before 6.0.3, drivers/gpu/drm/virtio/virtgpu_object.c misinterprets the drm_gem_shmem_get_sg_table return value (expects it to be NULL in the error case, whereas it is actually an error pointer).",
