    "Description": "The Linux kernel, based on version 4.19.91, heavily modified with backports\n\nCVE-2022-0812:\nAn information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.\n\nCVE-2022-1516:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel?s X.25 set of standardized network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.\n\nCVE-2022-1836:\n** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2022-33981. Reason: This candidate is a reservation duplicate of CVE-2022-33981. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2022-33981 instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.\n\nCVE-2022-20141:\nIn ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-112551163References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-20369:\nIn v4l2_m2m_querybuf of v4l2-mem2mem.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper input validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-223375145References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-20422:\nIn emulation_proc_handler of armv8_deprecated.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-237540956References: Upstream kernel\n\nCVE-2022-23960:\nCertain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-26373:\nNon-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\nCVE-2022-2663:\nAn issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured.\n\nCVE-2022-26966:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device.\n\nCVE-2022-3028:\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.\n\nCVE-2022-3169:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A denial of service flaw may occur if there is a consecutive request of the NVME_IOCTL_RESET and the NVME_IOCTL_SUBSYS_RESET through the device file of the driver, resulting in a PCIe link disconnect.\n\nCVE-2022-32296:\nThe Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 (\"Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm\") of RFC 6056.\n\nCVE-2022-32981:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.3 on powerpc 32-bit platforms. There is a buffer overflow in ptrace PEEKUSER and POKEUSER (aka PEEKUSR and POKEUSR) when accessing floating point registers.\n\nCVE-2022-33740:\nLinux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\nCVE-2022-33744:\nArm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further mappings of other guests' memory pages.\n\nCVE-2022-33981:\ndrivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function.\n\nCVE-2022-3521:\nA vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3545:\nA vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2022-3565:\nA vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211088.\n\nCVE-2022-3586:\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel?s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.\n\nCVE-2022-3594:\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to logging of excessive data. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211363.\n\nCVE-2022-3628:\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges.\n\nCVE-2022-3629:\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic.

Unprivileged guest users can compromise the guest kernel because TLB flush operations are mishandled in certain KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED situations.\n\nCVE-2022-39842:\n** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.\n\nCVE-2022-40307:\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.19.8. drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c has a race condition with a resultant use-after-free.\n\nCVE-2022-42895:\nThere is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely.
