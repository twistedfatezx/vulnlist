    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-0616:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nIf a MIME email combines OpenPGP and OpenPGP MIME data in a certain way Thunderbird repeatedly attempts to process and display the message, which could cause Thunderbird's user interface to lock up and no longer respond to the user's actions. An attacker could send a crafted message with this structure to attempt a DoS attack.\n\nCVE-2023-0767:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nAn attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled.\n\nCVE-2023-25728:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nThe `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header could allow an attacker to leak a child iframe's unredacted URI when interaction with that iframe triggers a redirect.\n\nCVE-2023-25729:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nPermission prompts for opening external schemes were only shown for `ContentPrincipals` resulting in extensions being able to open them without user interaction via `ExpandedPrincipals`. This could lead to further malicious actions such as downloading files or interacting with software already installed on the system.\n\nCVE-2023-25730:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nA background script invoking `requestFullscreen` and then blocking the main thread could force the browser into fullscreen mode indefinitely, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2023-25732:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nWhen encoding data from an `inputStream` in `xpcom` the size of the input being encoded was not correctly calculated potentially leading to an out of bounds memory write.\n\nCVE-2023-25735:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nCross-compartment wrappers wrapping a scripted proxy could have caused objects from other compartments to be stored in the main compartment resulting in a use-after-free after unwrapping the proxy.\n\nCVE-2023-25737:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nAn invalid downcast from `nsTextNode` to `SVGElement` could have lead to undefined behavior.\n\nCVE-2023-25739:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nModule load requests that failed were not being checked as to whether or not they were cancelled causing a use-after-free in `ScriptLoadContext`.\n\nCVE-2023-25742:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nWhen importing a SPKI RSA public key as ECDSA P-256, the key would be handled incorrectly causing the tab to crash.\n\nCVE-2023-25743:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nA lack of in app notification for entering fullscreen mode could have lead to a malicious website spoofing browser chrome.\n*This bug only affects Firefox Focus. Other versions of Firefox are unaffected.*\n\nCVE-2023-25744:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nMozilla developers Kershaw Chang and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 109 and Firefox ESR 102.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2023-25746:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nMozilla developers Philipp and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 102.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
