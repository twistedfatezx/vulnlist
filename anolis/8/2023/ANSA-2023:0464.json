    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2023-4045:\nOffscreen Canvas did not properly track cross-origin tainting, which could have been used to access image data from another site in violation of same-origin policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4046:\nIn some circumstances, a stale value could have been used for a global variable in WASM JIT analysis. This resulted in incorrect compilation and a potentially exploitable crash in the content process. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4047:\nA bug in popup notifications delay calculation could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4048:\nAn out-of-bounds read could have led to an exploitable crash when parsing HTML with DOMParser in low memory situations. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4049:\nRace conditions in reference counting code were found through code inspection. These could have resulted in potentially exploitable use-after-free vulnerabilities. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4050:\nIn some cases, an untrusted input stream was copied to a stack buffer without checking its size. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash which could have led to a sandbox escape. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4055:\nWhen the number of cookies per domain was exceeded in `document.cookie`, the actual cookie jar sent to the host was no longer consistent with expected cookie jar state. This could have caused requests to be sent with some cookies missing. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4056:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, Firefox ESR 102.13, Thunderbird 115.0, and Thunderbird 102.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116, Firefox ESR \u003c 102.14, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.\n\nCVE-2023-4057:\nMemory safety bugs present in Firefox 115, Firefox ESR 115.0, and Thunderbird 115.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 116 and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.1.",
