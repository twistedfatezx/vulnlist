    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-23981:\nA texture upload of a Pixel Buffer Object could have confused the WebGL code to skip binding the buffer used to unpack it, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable information leak or crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.\n\nCVE-2021-23982:\nUsing techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.\n\nCVE-2021-23984:\nA malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user into providing credentials. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.\n\nCVE-2021-23987:\nMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86 and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.",
