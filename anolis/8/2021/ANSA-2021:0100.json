    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-22883:\nNode.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.\n\nCVE-2021-22884:\nNode.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.\n\nCVE-2019-15605:\nHTTP request smuggling in Node.js 10, 12, and 13 causes malicious payload delivery when transfer-encoding is malformed\nA flaw was found in the Node.js code where a specially crafted HTTP(s) request sent to a Node.js server failed to properly process the HTTP(s) headers, resulting in a request smuggling attack. An attacker can use this flaw to alter a request sent as an authenticated user if the Node.js server is deployed behind a proxy server that reuses connections.\n\nCVE-2019-15606:\nIncluding trailing white space in HTTP header values in Nodejs 10, 12, and 13 causes bypass of authorization based on header value comparisons\nA flaw was found in Node.js where the HTTP(s) header values were not stripped of trailing whitespace. An attacker can use this flaw to send an HTTP(s) request which is validated by an upstream proxy server, but not by the Node.js HTTP(s) server.\n\nCVE-2020-7598:\nminimist before 1.2.2 could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using a \"constructor\" or \"__proto__\" payload.\nA flaw was found in nodejs-minimist, where it was tricked into adding or modifying properties of the Object.prototype using a \"constructor\" or \"__proto__\" payload. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
