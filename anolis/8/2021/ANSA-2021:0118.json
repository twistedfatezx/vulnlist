    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-23961:\nFurther techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 85.\n\nCVE-2021-23994:\nA WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-23995:\nWhen Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-23998:\nThrough complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-23999:\nIf a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have been loaded by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that should not be granted to web content. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-24002:\nWhen a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to the FTP server. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-29945:\nThe WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-29946:\nPorts that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit integer could have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.10, Thunderbird \u003c 78.10, and Firefox \u003c 88.\n\nCVE-2021-29948:\nSignatures are written to disk before and read during verification, which might be subject to a race condition when a malicious local process or user is replacing the file. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 78.10.",
