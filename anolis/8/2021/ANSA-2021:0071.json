    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-27918:\nencoding/xml in Go before 1.15.9 and 1.16.x before 1.16.1 has an infinite loop if a custom TokenReader (for xml.NewTokenDecoder) returns EOF in the middle of an element. This can occur in the Decode, DecodeElement, or Skip method.\n\nCVE-2021-31525:\nnet/http in Go before 1.15.12 and 1.16.x before 1.16.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a large header to ReadRequest or ReadResponse. Server, Transport, and Client can each be affected in some configurations.\n\nCVE-2021-33196:\nIn archive/zip in Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.\n\nCVE-2021-34558:\nThe crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic.\n\nCVE-2020-24553:\nGo before 1.14.8 and 1.15.x before 1.15.1 allows XSS because text/html is the default for CGI/FCGI handlers that lack a Content-Type header.\nA flaw was found in the Go standard library packages before upstream versions 1.15 and 1.14.8. Both the net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi packages use a default Content-Type response header value of \"text/html\", rather than \"text/plain\". This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this issue in applications using these packages by uploading crafted files, allowing a Cross-site Scripting attack (XSS). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\nCVE-2020-28362:\nGo before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.4 allows Denial of Service.\nA flaw was found in the math/big package of Go's standard library that causes a denial of service. Applications written in Go that use math/big via cryptographic packages, including crypto/rsa and crypto/x509, are vulnerable and can potentially cause panic via a crafted certificate chain. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-28366:\nGo before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.5 allows Code Injection.\nAn input validation vulnerability was found in Go. From a generated go file (from the cgo tool), it is possible to modify symbols within that object file and specify code. This flaw allows an attacker to create a repository that includes malicious pre-built object files that could execute arbitrary code when downloaded and run via `go get` or `go build` while building a Go project. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2020-28367:\nGo before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.5 allows Argument Injection.\nAn input validation vulnerability was found in Go. If cgo is specified in a Go file, it is possible to bypass the validation of arguments to the gcc compiler. This flaw allows an attacker to create a malicious repository that can execute arbitrary code when downloaded and run via `go get` or `go build` while building a Go project. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2021-3114:\nIn Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7, crypto/elliptic/p224.go can generate incorrect outputs, related to an underflow of the lowest limb during the final complete reduction in the P-224 field.\nA flaw detected in golang: crypto/elliptic, in which P-224 keys as generated can return incorrect inputs, reducing the strength of the cryptography. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality and integrity.",
