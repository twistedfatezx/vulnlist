    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2021-29969:\nIf Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and an attacker injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake, then Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted in Thunderbird showing incorrect information, for example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to show folders that didn't exist on the IMAP server. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u0026lt; 78.12.\n\nCVE-2021-29970:\nA malicious webpage could have triggered a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. *This bug could only be triggered when accessibility was enabled.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u0026lt; 78.12, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 78.12, and Firefox \u0026lt; 90.\n\nCVE-2021-29976:\nMozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox and Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u0026lt; 78.12, Firefox ESR \u0026lt; 78.12, and Firefox \u0026lt; 90.\n\nCVE-2021-30547:\nOut of bounds write in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.101 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.",
