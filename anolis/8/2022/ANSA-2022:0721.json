    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-40956:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that when injecting an HTML base element; some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri settings and accept the injected element's base instead.\n\nCVE-2022-40957:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of inconsistent data in the instruction and data cache when creating wasm code, which could lead to a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-40958:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that by injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain, which is not a secure context, could set and overwrite cookies from a secure context, leading to session fixation and other attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-40959:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized during iframe navigation, leading to a bypass that leaked device permissions into untrusted subdocuments.\n\nCVE-2022-40960:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe, leading to a use-after-free problem and causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-40962:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Jeff Muizelaar, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reporting memory safety bugs present in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and the presumption that with enough effort, some have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
