    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-45403:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin responses; but timing information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests might have allowed them to determine the presence or length of a media file.\n\nCVE-2022-45404:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Through a series of popup and window.print() calls, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-45405:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Freeing arbitrary nsIInputStream's on a different thread than creation could have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-45406:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-45408:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-45409:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and GCRuntime::finishCollection may not have been called, leading to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-45410:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with FetchEvent, the origin of the request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it. This had the effect of negating SameSite cookie protections. This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.\n\nCVE-2022-45411:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on fetch() and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as X-Http-Method-Override that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Firefox has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers.\n\nCVE-2022-45412:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: When resolving a symlink such as file:///proc/self/fd/1, an error message may be produced where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in the buffer.\n\nCVE-2022-45416:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Keyboard events reference strings like \"KeyA\" that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread addresses. Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out which keys were being pressed.\n\nCVE-2022-45418:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could have been drawn over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-45420:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Use tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be rendered outside the boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-45421:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 106 and Firefox ESR 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
