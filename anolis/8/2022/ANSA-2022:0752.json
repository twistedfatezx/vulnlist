    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-42927:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of a same-origin policy violation that could have allowed the theft of cross-origin URL entries, leaking the result of a redirect via `performance.getEntries()`.\n\nCVE-2022-42928:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of certain types of allocations that were missing annotations that, if the Garbage Collector was in a specific state, could lead to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-42929:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of a website called `window.print()` causing a denial of service of the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on the user's session restore settings.\n\nCVE-2022-42932:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of Mozilla developers Ashley Hale and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team, reporting memory safety bugs present in Firefox 105 and Firefox ESR 102.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and, with enough effort, exploited to run arbitrary code.",
