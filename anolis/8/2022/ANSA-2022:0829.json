    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-45414:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email and the email contained either a video tag with the poster attribute or an object tag with a data attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed regardless of a configuration to block remote content, and an image loaded from the poster attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targeting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033.\n\nCVE-2022-46872:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages.\n*This bug only affects Firefox for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*\n\nCVE-2022-46874:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid extension, leaving a malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user confusion and the execution of malicious code.\n\nCVE-2022-46878:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 107 and Firefox ESR 102.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2022-46880:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: A missing check related to tex units could have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-46881:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: An optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-46882:\nThe Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as: A use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.",
