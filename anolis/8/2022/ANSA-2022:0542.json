    "Description": "Package updates are available for Anolis 8 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2022-2200:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of if an attacker corrupted an object prototype, they could set undesired attributes on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution.\n\nCVE-2022-31744:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of an attacker that can inject CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as resources. In doing so, they can bypass a page's Content Security Policy.\n\nCVE-2022-34468:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of an iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a `javascript:` link.\n\nCVE-2022-34470:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of navigations between XML documents that may have led to a use-after-free problem and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nCVE-2022-34472:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue that if a PAC URL was set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP requests are blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown.\n\nCVE-2022-34479:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of a malicious website that creates a popup that could have resized the popup to overlay the address bar with its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks.\n\nCVE-2022-34481:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue within the `nsTArray_Impl::ReplaceElementsAt()` function, where an integer overflow could occur when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container.\n\nCVE-2022-34484:\nA flaw was found in Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes the issue of the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reporting potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101 and Firefox ESR 91.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, and we presume that with enough effort, some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
